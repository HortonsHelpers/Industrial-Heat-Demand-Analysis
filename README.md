# Industrial-Heat-Demand-Analysis
This analysis characterizes the combustion energy demands of 14 significant industries in the U.S. It also includes calculation of facility-level annual energy demand from 2010 to 2015 based on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) (https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting) and estimation of the potential to reduce fossil fuel use through three alternative heat generators (i.e., geothermal, solar industrial process heat [SIPH], and small modular nuclear reactors [SMRs]).
